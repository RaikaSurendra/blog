## Software

It's important to have your software set up to quickly test/prototype and make solutions.  Below are the things I think every developer needs and my personal applications I use.

### Rest Client

A seperate Rest Client is really important because otherwise you may login as the *test* account you're using.

Today I use [insomnia.rest](https://insomnia.rest/).  It's great.  I have a workspaces in it for my personal API's, Servicenow's API's and more.

Here's what it looks like, you can see also it's variable stuff where I have the `twitch.key` but it's not visible.

### Soap Client

Sometimes you are forced to use SOAP.  There is a pretty good tool for testing those connections locally called [SOAPUI](https://www.soapui.org/downloads/soapui.html).  It does have REST and SOAP things but I just use it for SOAP.  For servicenow projects, just goto the target table e.g. dev12345.service-now.com/ticket.do?WSDL, save the page as a file, and make a new Project using that file.

### Screen capture

I generally alternate between [Windows Snipping Tool](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13776/windows-use-snipping-tool-to-capture-screenshots) and [Screencast-o-matic](https://screencast-o-matic.com/).  If I need to do any kind of notation or video, I use Screencast-o-matic.  I initially used this as it supported Linux, Windows, and Mac, but now they only support Windows, and Mac.

If you're on windows this pairs well with [KeyPos√©](http://jungsbluth.de/magnus/blog/2008/08/01/keypose-flavour-your-screencasts-with-shortcuts/) to show keypresses.

### Password Manager

When I did consulting I had to remember hundreds of logins.  That's not an easy feat.  It was then I decided I'm going to use a password manager.  I've never looked back.  [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) has been great for me.  You have to make a few setting modifications so it doesnt set fields automatically (because you don't want it to update a password value accidentally).  Outside of that it's pretty great.

### Android Studio

[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) is awesome for mobile testing, but it does take some time to stand up.

### Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/download) is great.

### Text Editor

I'm going to try to tread lightly here.  Everyone has their favorites, I'm just going to say I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  There are a [number of great, popular ones](https://www.google.com/search?q=best+text+editor) to try out, it's nice to have one to work on files locally.

### Virtual Box

Sometimes you have to ensure your sites work on certain versions of IE as the updating of IE historically has been awful at a lot of places.  So when I found Microsoft officially makes virtual machines to test different versions of IE, I bookmarked that in a hurry.  Here is is, [Microsoft's Official Virtual Machines](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/).

## Accounts

### Github & Gitlab

If you have Git, you need a place you can use git.  These are two of the free services folks use.

- [Github](https://github.com) is the most known.
- [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com) has a ton of free features and allows free private repos.

### Servicenow

You need one of [these accounts](https://developer.servicenow.com) for a Personal Developer Instance.
